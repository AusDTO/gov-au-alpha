## Food Safety Supervisor Certificate

The Food Safety Supervisor Certificate (FSS Certificate) is issued by a state or territory food authority approved Registered Training Organisation (RTO). The RTO can issue the the FFS Certificate only after a FSS has completed the required training. 

A FSS certificate states that the person it is issued to is qualified to be a Food Safety Supervisor and it is valid for five years from the date of issue. 

It is a legal requirement that a copy of the FSS certificate is kept on the business premises at all times. Local Councils can carry out routine inspections of food businesses and authorised officers can ask to see a copy of the FSS certificate.
