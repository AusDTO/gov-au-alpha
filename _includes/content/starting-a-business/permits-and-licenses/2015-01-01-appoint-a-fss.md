## Food Safety Supervisor (FSS) Certificate

The FSS certificate is issued by a Registered Training Organisation (RTO) recognised by the state or territory food authority after the appointed Food Safety Supervisor has completed training. 

A FSS certificate states that the person it is issued to is qualified to be a Food Safety Supervisor and it is valid for five years from the date of issue. 

It is a legal requirement that a copy of the FSS certificate is kept on the business premises at all times. You will need to show your FSS certificate when your business is inspected by your local council.
