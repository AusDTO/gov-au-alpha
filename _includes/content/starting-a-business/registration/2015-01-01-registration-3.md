## Things to think about


#### Register the right business name
A business name is a big part of your identity so it’s worth researching what else exists online first. If you use your personal name for your business (eg. John Doe) you don’t have to register it. But if you want to be called ‘John Doe & Co’ you will need to register it as this is not your personal name.

#### Register for an ABN
When you register an Australian business you can also apply for your Australian Business Number (ABN). If you’re registering a company, you will need to apply for an Australian Company Number (ACN) first and then apply for an ABN.

#### Get your business structure right
Business structure (sole trader, partnership, company or trust) affects the way your income is taxed, your operating costs, how you will be able to protect your assets, and how clients and other businesses will deal with you.

#### Understand GST and other taxes
The taxes you have to pay will depend on your choice of business structure. The key taxes affecting businesses are Company (income) Tax, Capital Gains Tax (CGT) and the Goods and Services Tax (GST). [Learn how tax works](http://busgov.github.io/registration/registration1/home.html)
