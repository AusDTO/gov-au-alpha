##Living in Australia

There is no such thing as a typical Australian lifestyle. Some Australians choose to live a more laid-back lifestyle in country and coastal towns and others choose to live in busy cosmopolitan cities. Australians, no matter where they choose to stay, enjoy a high quality lifestyle.
