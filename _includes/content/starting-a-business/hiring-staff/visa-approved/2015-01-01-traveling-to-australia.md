## Travelling to and from Australia

Australian visas are issued and recorded electronically. Your visa is now linked to the passport you referenced in your application. When you check-in for your flight to Australia, airline staff will use your passport to check your visa. You can enter and leave Australia as frequently as you wish for the length of your visa.
