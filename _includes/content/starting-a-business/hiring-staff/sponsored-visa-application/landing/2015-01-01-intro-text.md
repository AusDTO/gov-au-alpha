## Apply for a sponsored work visa (subclass 457)

The subclass 457 visa allows you to:

- work in Australia for a period of between one day and 4 years 
- bring any eligible dependants with you to Australia â€” dependants can work and study
- after entering Australia, have no limit on the number of times you can travel in and out of Australia.

Do not finalise any travel arrangements until after your visa is granted. This is because visa processing times can vary depending on the visa type, your personal circumstances and whether any information is incomplete.
