## Employing staff


Youâ€™ll need to register for tax and set up super contributions before employing staff.  Workers comp and other types of insurance might also be needed.

See the [Fair Work Ombudsman](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/find-help-for/small-business/hiring-employees) for more about employment types, award rates and how to recruit the right people for your business.
