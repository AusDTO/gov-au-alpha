## Importing

Importing goods can help your business meet its goals and provide goods to customers that may not be available locally.

To ensure your importing is successful, you'll need to be aware of government regulations, including clearance by the [Department of Immigration and Border Protection](http://www.border.gov.au/Busi/Impo) (DIBP) and duty taxes.
