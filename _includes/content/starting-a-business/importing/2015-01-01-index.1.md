## Find a local import supplier

To import cheese a â€˜Dairy Product for Human Consumption' import permit is required by law from the [Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/import).

It may be easier for you to source imported cheese products you want to sell from a local supplier by searching the Austrade Australian Suppliers Directory.
