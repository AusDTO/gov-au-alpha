## Importing

Importing goods can help your business meet its goals and provide goods to customers that may not be available locally.

To ensure your importing is successful, youâ€™ll need to be aware of government regulations, including clearance by the [Department of Immigration and Border Protection (DIBP](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/import)) and duty taxes.
