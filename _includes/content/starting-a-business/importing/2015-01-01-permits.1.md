## Import permit you need

You need to apply for the import permit that will allow you to import 'Dairy products for human consumption' by submitting an import permit application for: 'Cheese and butter from a country free from foot and mouth disease' to the [Department of Agriculture and Water Resources](http://www.agriculture.gov.au/import).

From what you've told us it may be easier for you to Search for a local supplier of this imported cheese using the [Austrade Australian Suppliers Directory](http://www.austrade.gov.au/suppliersearch.aspx?folderid=1736).
