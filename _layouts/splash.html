        <h2>Building GOV.AU</h2>
        <div class="row">

          <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-8">
            <p>
              The GOV.AU Prototype was built by the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) to meet the Digital Service Standards. All Australian Government digital services must meet the standards, which ensure that services delivered online are simple, fast and easy to use.
            </p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
              A team of developers, designers and researchers had <strong>9 weeks</strong> to move through the first two phases of the service design and delivery process - Discovery and Alpha. Working collaboratively in an industry hub, the team rapidly built and iterated the prototype for public release.
            </p>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
              During the <strong>Discovery</strong> phase, user research took place over four weeks. The team wanted to see if it was possible to create government services online, that allow users to easily do the things with government they want to do, in the one place.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two fictional characters were introduced to show how GOV.AU can be used to: start a business (Matt), become an approved business sponsor (Matt) and apply for a visa (Ken).
            </p>
            <h3>How we did it</h3>
            <p>
              The <strong>Alpha</strong> phase saw the build of GOV.AU happen in five weeks. Sketched in code, the prototype is designed to focus around a single task 'Starting a business'. It works by a user answering a few simple questions, so that the answers can be matched to the right (local, state and federal) information based on their situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              Checklists with links are also provided. The three checklists allow a user to explore what they can do to start a task, like applying for licences and permits or guide a user to more specific information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several pages were also built to show how content could be rendered. None of the pages built are intended to be correct because they exist for illustrative purposes only.
            </p>
