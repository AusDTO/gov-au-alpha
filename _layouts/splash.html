              How might we design government information so people don’t have to understand the structure of
              government to get things done? This GOV.AU prototype is an example of how joined up government
              services could look and work for users.

        <h2>Building GOV.AU</h2>
        <div class="row">

          <div class="col-sm-12 col-lg-8">
            <p>
              The GOV.AU Prototype was built by the Digital Transformation Office (DTO) to meet the Digital Service Standards. All Australian Government digital services must meet the standards, to ensure that services delivered online are simple, fast and easy to use.
            </p>
            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>
              A team of developers, designers and researchers had <strong>nine weeks</strong> to move through the first two phases of the service design and delivery process, Discovery (phase 1) and Alpha (phase 2) where they built and polished this prototype for a public release online.
            </p>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>
              During the <strong>Discovery</strong> phase, user research took place over four weeks to see if it was possible to create government services in a way that makes them so easy to use, that people wouldn't need to know the structure of government to complete the things they need to do.
              <br/>
              As Discovery progressed, two fictional characters were introduced, to show what the journey of starting a business (Matt) and the journey of coming to Australia (Ken) may look like on a new GOV.AU.
            </p>
            <h3>How we did it</h3>
            <p>
              The <strong>Alpha</strong> phase saw the rapid build of GOV.AU take place over five weeks. The prototype was sketched in code and the design focuses on a single task 'Starting a business' which eventually needs to hire overseas staff. It works by a user answering a few simple questions upfront and then matches the right government information (local, state and federal) to the user’s situation. Checklists are then provided with links so the user can explore further what they can do to start a task or find out more information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Several Ministers' and Department pages have been built to illustrate how different types of content could be rendered. The pages are not intended to be correct because they exist for illustrative purposes only.
