# Working after retirement

<p class="lead-paragraph">Retirement doesn’t necessarily mean having to stop work completely. Continuing to work has many benefits; financial, emotional and social. You may be able to access your Super and/or the Aged Pension and still work part-time after you ‘retire’.
</p>

### How old do I have to be?

You can access your super when you turn 65 (even if you haven’t retired). Super funds call this your ‘preservation age’. You can apply to get the Aged Pension in Australia from the age of 65 but this is changing to 67 ([check your birth year](#))

### Working part-time while getting super payments

You may be able to reduce your work to part-time and receive payments from your Super savings at the same time. If you decide to receive your Super in one lump sum you must have the intent to retire but might be able to work less than 10 hours per week. Check with the [Australian Tax Office](#) and your Super Fund about this.

### Working part-time while getting the Aged Pension

If you decide to apply for the Aged Pension you may also work part-time. An incentive called Work Bonus lets pensioners do part-time work and still receive part of your pension. At the moment the first $250 of money earned over a fortnight is not assessed and is not counted under the pension income test.

### Worried about not having enough super?

Many Australians share this worry, especially if you’ve taken time out of the workforce to have children, had breaks due to illness or you haven’t followed a traditional career path.

In Australia the Aged Pension provides income support and access to a range of concessions for eligible older Australians. You must be at least at least 65 years old and meet an income and assets test.
