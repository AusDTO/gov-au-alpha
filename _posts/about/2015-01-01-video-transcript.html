<h2> Video 'Starting a business: Bobbi's journey with GOV.AU'
<h3> Speaker 1
  <p>
  [Digital Transformation Office logo and australian government coat of arms] What if we make government services [words on screen say simpler clearer faster] so easy to use that people don't need to know how government is structured to get things done? We've spent the last nine weeks imagining how it might work when we bring different government services together to better meet user needs.
</p>
<p>
  [words on screen say Starting a business: Bobbi’s journey with gov a u] Meet Bobbi. A fashion buyer for a well-known Australian fashion retailer. Bobbi's dream is to own a store that sells clothes, homewares, and fabrics imported from Japan. She also plans to serve coffee, sake, and snacks in her store.
</p>
<p>
  When Bobbi tells her friends and family of her plans, they warn her that it will take months to get her shop open. But, when Bobbi [mobile screenshot start questionnaire New to starting a business?] Googles, 'How do I start a business,' the first search result is from the new GOV.AU. </p>
</p>
<p>
  [mobile screenshot questionnaire What will your business do? Cafe operation Serving sake Japanese fashion] She starts by answering a few simple questions about her business. GOV.AU brings together [mobile screenshot questionnaire How will your business trade? Online Shop] everything she needs to know and do to get her business up and running in Australia.
</p>
<p>
  There's a simple task list for Bobbi to follow. She can see what she needs to complete with government. [mobile screenshot questionnaire What business structure do you plan to use? Company. Words on screen say Single Online Business Registration Space and show logos for Australian Securities and Investments Commission Australian Taxation Office Department of Industry Innovation and Science and The Treasury] Bobbi notices that she can register her business name, get her ABN, and tax setup in the one place, which will save her time. She is told about all the licenses and permits she'll need for her business. She can start applying for these online because her store is in New South Wales.
</p>
<p>
  Bobbi wasn't even thinking about grants. [mobile screenshot start questionnaire Funding and support] It never occurred to her that she would be eligible for any help. [mobile screenshot questionnaire Do you identity with any of the following? I am Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander I am female] But she can now easily take advantage of some much needed support because [ mobile screenshot your business checklist funding and support] GOV.AU brings together all grant and training information that's relevant to her.
</p>
<p>
  Eleven months later, Bobbi gets an unexpected email from GOV.AU congratulating her on the upcoming anniversary of her business. [mobile screenshot of the email from gov a u] She notices some information on how to find staff and learns that she might be able to sponsor a skilled worker from overseas.
</p>
<p>
  [mobile screenshot start questionnaire Finding staff] This is perfect timing. Bobbi was thinking about bringing a fashion designer, Haruki, who she knows from Japan to help her grow her business and teach her Australian team new skills. Bobbi didn't know how to employ someone from overseas. [mobile screenshot questionnaire What will your business do? Cafe operation Serving sake Japanese fashion] But just like when she started her business, once she answers a few simple questions, she's given clear instructions and a list of all the things she needs to do.
</p>
<p>
  [mobile screenshot questionnaire What nationality is the person you’ll employ? Japanese] When she does some more investigating, GOV.AU let's her know that her business is qualified to bring someone in. She didn't even have to re-enter her business information. Bobbi now understands what she needs to do to sponsor Haruki and completes her application. She can now track the progress of the Visa application.

<p>
  Meanwhile in Japan, Haruki has been worried about the process of coming to Australia to work for Bobbi. He wants to, but he doesn't know where to start. Haruki receives an email letting him know that he's been nominated for a role as fashion designer in Bobbi's company. [mobile screenshot of the email from gov a u shows the sponsored visa is for Temporary Work (Skilled) (Subclass 457) visa] From the email, Haruki has access to the Visa application checklist that he and his partner can complete together.
</p>
<p>
  [mobile screen of the website is shown, scrolling through the information Apply for an Australian visa checklist] Because Bobbi has already provided some of the information, Haruki doesn't have to enter everything again. He confirms and accepts the details of his sponsorship. Both the Australian Government and Bobbi are notified. Haruki and Bobbi are both sent an email as soon as his Visa is approved. He gets a new checklist on GOV.AU to help him and his partner prepare for living and working in Australia.

[mobile screenshot of GOV.AU home screen the words on screen say this will work across different government services] We believe that our design approach will work well with many other government services in Australia. This is how we can make government services simpler, clearer, and faster.
