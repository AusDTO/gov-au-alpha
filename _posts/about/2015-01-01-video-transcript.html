          Speaker 1:	What if we make government services so easy to use that people don't need to know how government is structured to get things done? We've spent the last nine weeks imagining how it might work when we bring different government services together to better meet user needs.<br/>
          Meet Bobbi. A fashion buyer for a well-known Australian fashion retailer. Bobbi's dream is to own a store that sells clothes, homewares, and fabrics imported from Japan. She also plans to serve coffee, sake, and snacks in her store.<br/>
          When Bobbi tells her friends and family of her plans, they warn her that it will take months to get her shop open. But, when Bobbi Googles, "How do I start a business," the first search result is from the new GOV.AU. She starts by answering a few simple questions about her business. GOV.AU brings together everything she needs to know and do to get her business up and running in Australia.<br/>
          There's a simple task list for Bobbi to follow. She can see what she needs to complete with government. Bobbi notices that she can register her business name, get her ABN, and text setup in the one place, which will save her time. She is told about all the licenses and permits she'll need for her business. She can start applying for these online because her store is in New South Wales.<br/>
          Bobbi wasn't even thinking about grants. It never occurred to her that she would be eligible for any help. But she can now easily take advantage of some much needed support because GOV.AU brings together all grant and training information that's relevant to her.<br/>
          Eleven months later, Bobbi gets an unexpected email from GOV.AU congratulating her on the upcoming anniversary of her business. She notices some information on how to find staff and learns that she might be able to sponsor a skilled worker from overseas.<br/>
          This is perfect timing. Bobbi was thinking about bringing a fashion designer, Haruki, who she knows from Japan to help her grow her business and teach her Australian team new skills. Bobbi didn't know how to employ someone from overseas. But just like when she started her business, once she answers a few simple questions, she's given clear instructions and a list of all the things she needs to do.<br/>
          When she does some more investigating, GOV.AU let's her know that her business is qualified to bring someone in. She didn't even have to re-enter her business information. Bobbi now understands what she needs to do to sponsor Haruki and completes her application. She can now track the progress of the Visa application.<br/>
          Meanwhile in Japan, Haruki has been worried about the process of coming to Australia to work for Bobbi. He wants to, but he doesn't know where to start. Haruki receives an email letting him know that he's been nominated for a role as fashion designer in Bobbi's company. From the email, Haruki has access to the Visa application checklist that he and his partner can complete together.<br/>
          Because Bobbi has already provided some of the information, Haruki doesn't have to enter everything again. He confirms and accepts the details of his sponsorship. Both the Australian Government and Bobbi are notified. Haruki and Bobbi are both sent an email as soon as his Visa is approved. He gets a new checklist on GOV.AU to help him and his partner prepare for living and working in Australia.<br/>
          What we've just shown is how GOV.AU can bring together different parts of government in a way that lets people get things done without feeling confused, overwhelmed, and getting it wrong. We believe that our design approach will work well with many other government services in Australia. This is how we can make government services simpler, clearer, faster, and more humane.<br/>
