## Starting a business: Bobbi's journey with GOV.AU

What if we make government services so easy to use that people don't need to know how government is
structured to get things done? We've spent the last nine weeks imagining how it might work when we
bring different government services together to better meet user needs.

Meet Bobbi. A fashion buyer for a well-known Australian fashion retailer. Bobbi's dream is to own a
store that sells clothes, homewares, and fabrics imported from Japan. She also plans to serve
coffee, sake, and snacks in her store.

When Bobbi tells her friends and family of her plans, they warn her that it will take months to
get her shop open. But, when Bobbi Googles, 'How do I start a business,' the first search result
is from the new GOV.AU and a questionnaire “New to starting a business?”.

She starts by answering a few simple questions about her business:

* What will your business do?
    * Cafe operation Serving sake Japanese fashion
* How will your business trade?
    * Online Shop

GOV.AU brings together everything she needs to know and do to get her business up and running in
Australia.

There's a simple task list for Bobbi to follow. She can see what she needs to complete with government.

* What business structure do you plan to use?
    * Company.

Bobbi is directed to the Single Online Business Registration Space and notices that she can register
her business name, get her ABN, and tax setup in the one place, which will save her time.
She is told about all the licenses and permits she'll need for her business. She can start
applying for these online because her store is in New South Wales.

Bobbi wasn't even thinking about grants. She starts the Funding and support questionnaire.
It never occurred to her that she would be eligible for any help.

* Do you identify with any of the following?
    * I am Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander
    * I am female

But she can now easily take advantage of some much needed support because the
‘business checklist funding and support’ page from GOV.AU brings together all grant and
training information that's relevant to her.

Eleven months later, Bobbi gets an unexpected email from GOV.AU congratulating her on the
upcoming anniversary of her business. She notices some information on how to find staff
and learns that she might be able to sponsor a skilled worker from overseas.

This is perfect timing. Bobbi was thinking about bringing a fashion designer, Haruki, who she
knows from Japan to help her grow her business and teach her Australian team new skills.
She starts the questionnaire about Finding Staff.

Bobbi didn't know how to employ someone from overseas.

* What will your business do?
    * Cafe operation Serving sake Japanese fashion

But just like when she started her business, once she answers a few simple questions,
she's given clear instructions and a list of all the things she needs to do.

When she does some more investigating, GOV.AU let's her know that her business is qualified
to bring someone in

* What nationality is the person you’ll employ?
    * Japanese

She didn't even have to re-enter her business information. Bobbi now understands what
she needs to do to sponsor Haruki and completes her application. She can now track the progress
of the Visa application via the sponsor checklist Track and Share.

Meanwhile in Japan, Haruki has been worried about the process of coming to Australia to work
for Bobbi. He wants to, but he doesn't know where to start. Haruki receives an email letting
him know that he's been nominated for a role as fashion designer in Bobbi's company.
The sponsored visa will be for “Temporary Work (Skilled) (Subclass 457)”.

From the email, Haruki has access to the Visa application checklist that he and his partner can
complete together.

Because Bobbi has already provided some of the information, Haruki doesn't have to enter
everything again. He confirms and accepts the details of his sponsorship. Both the Australian
Government and Bobbi are notified. Haruki and Bobbi are both sent an email as soon as his Visa
is approved. He gets a new checklist on GOV.AU to help him and his partner prepare for living
and working in Australia.

What we've just shown is how GOV.AU can bring together different parts of government such as
Australian Securities and Investments Commission Australian Business Register Australian
Taxation Office Department of Immigration and Border Protection Department of Industry Innovation
and Science Fair Work Ombudsman Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, The NSW Government Food
Authority and Service NSW. Local government the City of Sydney. We think it’s possible to do that
in a way that lets people get things done without feeling confused, overwhelmed, or getting it wrong.

We believe that our design approach will work well with many other government services
and across different government services in Australia. This is how we can make government
services simpler, clearer, and faster.
