## Starting a business: Matt's journey with GOV.AU

What if we make government services so easy to use that people don't need to know how government is
structured to get things done? We spent nine weeks imagining how it might work when we bring different
government services together, to better meet user needs.

Meet Matt, a passionate cyclist, whose dream is to open his own bike shop. He’d also like to develop his own
mountain bike jersey range one day, and plans to open a small cafe as part of the business.

When Matt tells his friends and family of his plans, they warn him that it will take months to
get his shop open. But when Matt Google's 'How do I start a business' the first search result is
from the new GOV.AU.

He starts by answering a few simple questions about his business:
* What will your business do?
  * bicycle retailing,
  * sports clothing retailing,
  * cafe operation.

* How will your business trade?
  * online,
  * shop.

GOV.AU brings together everything he needs to know and do, to get his business up and running in Australia.

There's a simple task list for Matt to follow. He can see what he needs to complete with government.

* What business structure do you plan to use?
  * Company.

Matt is directed to the single online business registration space. Matt notices that he can register his business name, get his ABN,
and tax set up in the one place, which will save him time.

He is told about all the licenses and permits he'll need for his business. He can start applying for these online because his store is in New South Wales.

* Where is your shop located?
  * Same as registered business location: 1 Main Street, Orange, New South Wales, Australia.

Matt wasn't even thinking about grants. He starts the Funding and support questionnaire.
It never occurred to his that he would be eligible for any help.

* Do you identify with any of the following?
  * My business will be trading in a rural or regional area,
  * I am Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander.

But he can now easily take advantage of some much needed support because the section
about funding and support on the 'Starting a business checklist' page, at GOV.AU
brings together all grant and training information that's relevant to him.

11 months later, Matt gets an unexpected email from GOV.AU, congratulating him on the
upcoming anniversary of his business. He notices some information on how to find staff
and learns that he might be able to sponsor a skilled worker from overseas.

This is perfect timing. Matt was thinking about inviting a fellow cyclist, Ken who he met on a cycle challenge in Japan, to help him expand his business.

Ken has some great ideas about developing custom made mountain bikes, especially designed for Australian conditions, which would be perfect for Matt’s business.

He starts the questionnaire about Finding Staff. Matt didn't know how to employ someone from overseas.

* What position do you want to employ someone for?
  * Industrial designer.

But, just like when he started his business, once he answers a few simple questions, he's given clear instructions and a list of all the things he needs to do.

When he does some more investigating, GOV.AU let's him know that his business is qualified to bring someone in.

* What nationality is the person you’ll employ?
  * Japanese

He didn't even have to re-enter his business information. Matt now understands what he needs to do, to sponsor Ken and completes his application.
He can now track the progress of the Visa application, by using the sponsor checklist 'Track and share' feature.

Meanwhile in Japan... Ken wants to work for Matt but has been worried about the process of coming to Australia. He wants to come but he doesn't know where to start.

Ken receives an email letting him know that he's been nominated for a role as a industral designer in Matt's company. The sponsored visa Ken will be able to
apply for is the Temporary Work (Skilled) Visa (subclass 457) and his partner is also able to join him in Australia.

From the email, Ken has access to the Visa application checklist, that he and his partner can complete together.

Because Matt has already provided some of the information, Ken doesn't have to enter everything again. He confirms and accepts the details of his sponsorship. Both the Australian Government and Matt are notified.

Ken and Matt are both sent an email as soon as his Visa is approved. He gets a new checklist on GOV.AU to help him and his partner prepare for living
and working in Australia.

What we've just shown is how GOV.AU can bring together different parts of government such as; the Australian Securities and Investments Commission,
Australian Business Register, Australian Taxation Office, Department of Immigration and Border Protection,
Department of Industry, Innovation and Science, the Fair Work Ombudsman, Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the NSW Government Food Authority and Service NSW,
and local government, the City of Orange.

We think it’s possible to do that in a way that lets people get things done without feeling confused, overwhelmed, or getting it wrong.

We believe that our design approach will work well with many other government services in Australia. This is how we can make government services simpler, clearer, and faster.
