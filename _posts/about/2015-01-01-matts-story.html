## Starting a business: Matt's journey with GOV.AU

What if we make government services so easy to use that people don't need to know how government is
structured to get things done? We've spent the last nine weeks imagining how it might work when we
bring different government services together to better meet user needs.

Meet Matt. A fashion buyer for a well-known Australian fashion retailer. Matt's dream is to own a
store that sells clothes, homewares, and fabrics imported from Japan. He also plans to serve
coffee, sake, and snacks in hisstore.

When Matt tells hisfriends and family of hisplans, they warn histhat it will take months to
get hisshop open. But, when Matt Googles, 'How do I start a business,' the first search result
is from the new GOV.AU and a questionnaire “New to starting a business?”.

He starts by answering a few simple questions about hisbusiness:

* What will your business do?
    * Cafe operation Serving sake Japanese fashion
* How will your business trade?
    * Online Shop

GOV.AU brings together everything he needs to know and do to get hisbusiness up and running in
Australia.

There's a simple task list for Matt to follow. He can see what he needs to complete with government.

* What business structure do you plan to use?
    * Company.

Matt is directed to the Single Online Business Registration Space and notices that he can register
her business name, get hisABN, and tax setup in the one place, which will save histime.
He is told about all the licenses and permits she'll need for hisbusiness. He can start
applying for these online because hisstore is in New South Wales.

Matt wasn't even thinking about grants. He starts the Funding and support questionnaire.
It never occurred to histhat he would be eligible for any help.

* Do you identify with any of the following?
    * I am Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander
    * I am female

But he can now easily take advantage of some much needed support because the
‘business checklist funding and support’ page from GOV.AU brings together all grant and
training information that's relevant to her.

Eleven months later, Matt gets an unexpected email from GOV.AU congratulating hison the
upcoming anniversary of hisbusiness. He notices some information on how to find staff
and learns that he might be able to sponsor a skilled worker from overseas.

This is perfect timing. Matt was thinking about bringing a industrial designer, Haruki, who she
knows from Japan to help hisgrow hisbusiness and teach hisAustralian team new skills.
He starts the questionnaire about Finding Staff.

Matt didn't know how to employ someone from overseas.

* What will your business do?
    * Cafe operation Serving sake Japanese fashion

But just like when he started hisbusiness, once he answers a few simple questions,
she's given clear instructions and a list of all the things he needs to do.

When he does some more investigating, GOV.AU let's hisknow that hisbusiness is qualified
to bring someone in

* What nationality is the person you’ll employ?
    * Japanese

He didn't even have to re-enter hisbusiness information. Matt now understands what
he needs to do to sponsor Ken and completes hisapplication. He can now track the progress
of the Visa application via the sponsor checklist Track and Share.

Meanwhile in Japan, Ken has been worried about the process of coming to Australia to work
for Matt. He wants to, but he doesn't know where to start. Ken receives an email letting
him know that he's been nominated for a role as industrial designer in Matt's company.
The sponsored visa will be for “Temporary Work (Skilled) (Subclass 457)”.

From the email, Ken has access to the Visa application checklist that he and his partner can
complete together.

Because Matt has already provided some of the information, Ken doesn't have to enter
everything again. He confirms and accepts the details of his sponsorship. Both the Australian
Government and Matt are notified. Ken and Matt are both sent an email as soon as his Visa
is approved. He gets a new checklist on GOV.AU to help him and his partner prepare for living
and working in Australia.

What we've just shown is how GOV.AU can bring together different parts of government such as
Australian Securities and Investments Commission Australian Business Register Australian
Taxation Office Department of Immigration and Border Protection Department of Industry Innovation
and Science Fair Work Ombudsman Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, The NSW Government Food
Authority and Service NSW. Local government the City of Sydney. We think it’s possible to do that
in a way that lets people get things done without feeling confused, overwhelmed, or getting it wrong.

We believe that our design approach will work well with many other government services
and across different government services in Australia. This is how we can make government
services simpler, clearer, and faster.
